    <h3>Brief Summary:</h3>
    <p>Taraz, a.k.a Talas to foreigners, is one of the oldest cities in Kazakhstan. The countdown started when a fortress was built in the area during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zhizhi"> Battle of Zhizhi</a> in 36 BCE. Taraz was given its name in 568 BCE by Menander Protector who named it "Talas".</p>
    <p>The medieval city was a major trade center along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>. Taraz secured a place in history by virtue of the Battle of Talas (751 CE) which was fought between forces of the Chinese Tang dynasty and the Arab Abbasid Califate. One of the indirect outcomes of the battle was the introduction of paper to the West via Arabs capturing Chinese paper makers.</p>
